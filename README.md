the Data provides information about product sales in different cities and by different visitors
the data was able to give me 75% accuracy in question information

## Challenges 
Time Constraints: This project required a comprehensive understanding of various SQL queries and database structures. Despite having a good grasp on SQL fundamentals, the extensive nature of the project tasks often made it difficult to complete them within the specified timeline.
Unclear Workload: The scope of the project seemed to expand over time. Initially, the tasks seemed straightforward, but as the project progressed, new requirements and additional complexities were introduced.

## Future Goals
I will work more in my data cleaning
